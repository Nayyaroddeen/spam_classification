# spam_classification
This project contains the source files for the classification algorithms such as
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network, Convolution Neural Network for
spam classification.

## Dataset Preparation
The dataset is downloaded from this(http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/software_and_datasets/Enron-Spam/index.html) location. In particular
Enron1(http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/software_and_datasets/Enron-Spam/preprocessed/enron1.tar.gz) from the Enron-Spam in pre-processed form.
While preparing the dataset I've selected  10% of the data as test set randomly and remaining 90% of the for the training and validation sets.

## Feature Representation Techniques
### I used following techniques to represent the techniques.
    1. Word Count Feature Vector
    2. Kcore features
    3. Novel Graph Coloring based feature extraction
    4. Tf-Idf


## Classification Algorithms
### I used following classification algorithms
    1. Logistic Regression
    2. Random Forest
    3. Neural Network
    4. Convolution Neural Network

As the spam classification problem is a binary classification problem initially I started with
Logistic Regression.
